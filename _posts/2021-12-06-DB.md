#Database
## How database represent database in files on disk

## Database System Concept chapter 10.2
### Disk track sector
- The disk surface is divided into **tracks**, which are subdivided into 
  **sectors**.
  
- Sectors are typically **512** bytes
### Disk-Block Access

- The term **page** is often refer to **block**, block sizes range from
512 bytes to several kilobytes.
  
- A **sequential access** pattern is successive requests for successive block numbers, which
are on the same track or on adjacent track. It may only require a seek to the first block.
  
- **random access** is successive requests for blocks that are randomly located on the disk.

### Way to improve speed of access to blocks
- Buffering, blocks that are read from disk are stored in memory.
- Read-ahead, when a disk block is accessed, consecutive blocks from the same track are read into memory.
not very useful for random access.
  
- Scheduling, elevator algorithm.

- File organization, to reduce block access time, we can organize blocks on disk in a way that corresponds closely to
the way we expect data to be accessed.
  
### Page
- Hardware and OS page is normally 4KB
- Database page is 512B to 16KB
- Hardware can guarantee 4KB atomic
