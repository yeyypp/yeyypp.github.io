# Go Slice

- Slice internals  
The internals data structure consists of a pointer to array, length of the segment and capacity of the segment. If you assign one slice to another, both refer to the same array.
- Growing  
```
func AppendByte(s []byte, data ...byte) []byte {
    m := len(s)
    n := m + len(data)
    if n > cap(s) {
        newSlice := make([]byte, (n + 1) * 2)
        copy(newSlice, s)
        s = newSlice
        }
    s = s[:n]
    copy(s[m:n], data)
    return slice
}
```
- Filter
```
func Filter(s []int, f func(int) bool) []int {
    var newSlice []int
    for _, v := range s {
        if f(v) {
            newSlice = append(newSlice, v)
            }
        }
    }
    return newSlice
}
```
- Two-dimensional slices  
First, allocate a line at a time.
```
picture := make([][]uint8, YSize)
for i, _ := range picture {
    picture[i] = make([]uint8, XSize)
    }
}
```

As one allocation, sliced into lines.
```
picture := make([][]uint8, YSize)
pixels := make([]uint8, XSize * YSize)
for i, _ := range picture {
    picture[i], pixels = pixels[:XSize], pixels[XSize:]
    }
}
```

- When use slice as parameter
if we use append inside function, we need use pointer of slice as parameter, because the append operation may create a new slice and leave the old slice unchanged.
if we need to modify the slice, create a variable equals to the value of pointer of slice. Then modify it, and make the pointer point to it at last.
For example [https://leetcode.com/problems/permutations/submissions/](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutations/submissions/)


```
func help(tem *[]int) {}

func modify(tem *[]int) {
    a := *tem
    a = a[:len(a) - 1]
    *tem = a
    }
```
